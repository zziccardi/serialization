<H2>  Project Description  </H2>

<H3> Checkpointing Objects </H3>

The purpose of this assignment is to create a generic library to
serialize and deserialize objects. The code should allow the
conversion of objects into a wire format. The code should be designed
using dynamic proxies and reflection so that addition of new objects
or serialization formats causes minimal changes (reduces the ripple
effect).

<UL> 

<LI> Creating the Dynamic Proxy

<UL>
<LI> The Driver code should call the <I> createProxy </I>
method in the ProxyCreator utility class to create a dynamic proxy reference. The
code inside the createProxy method is shown below. 


<PRE>
 StoreRestoreI  serDeserObj =
            (StoreRestoreI)
            Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                                   getClass().getClassLoader(),
                                   interfaceArray,
                                   handler
                                   );

</PRE>

<LI> Pass an array of interfaces to the createProxy method with the
following interfaces (StoreI, RestoreI).

<PRE>

public interface StoreI extends StoreRestoreI {
      void writeObj(MyAllTypesFirst aRecord, int authID, String wireFormat);
      void writeObj(MyAllTypesSecond bRecord, int authID, String wireFormat);
}

public interface RestoreI extends StoreRestoreI {
      SerializableObject readObj(String wireFormat);
}


</PRE>

<LI> SerializablObject is an empty base class
<LI> MyAllTypesFirst extends SerializableObject
<LI> MyAllTypesSecond extends SerializableObject
<LI> StoreRestoreI.java is a tag interface
<LI> wireFormat is pseudoXML as shown in the sample files.
<LI> authID is an integer in the range of 1-9999

<LI> Pass an invocation handler to the createProxy() utility method.

</UL>

</UL>

<LI> Design two Java classes MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond with
data members that have names and types as shown in the serialized
format shown in the file <a
href="./MyAllTypes2.txt">MyAllTypes2.txt</a>. These two classes should
have the appropriate setX and getX methods.

<LI> Here is an example of multiple instances of the the two types in serialized pseudoXML format:
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="./MyAllTypes2.txt">MyAllTypes2.txt</a>.
</UL>


<LI> Do NOT use an XML parser. The above format is NOT compliant with
XML standards and so XML parsers will not work. Use the Java string
library API to parse the pseudoXML format. For example, you can use
substring library to find specific values within XML tags.

<LI> Note that the data members for an instance may appear in a diffrent order in the serialized format.


<LI> Note that you need to read the value of "xsi:type" to determine
if a "genericCheckpointing.util.MyAllTypesFirst" or
"genericCheckpointing.util.MyAllTypesSecond" needs to be created, via
reflection.

<LI> If you add new method names to the interfaces note that the
methods names in the proxy interfaces should be unique (don't
use the same method name in two different interfaces, as it will cause
problems with dynamic proxy usage).

<LI> The driver code should invoke methods on the dynamic
proxy, as if it is invoking methods on an object that implements the 2
interfaces (StoreI and RestoreI). Remember to cast the dynamic proxy to the
correct interface before invoking the method.

<LI> Each invocation will transfer control to the <I> invoke </I>
method of the invocation handler.

<LI> Invoke a method on the invocation handler to set a file name for
the checkpoint file. Alternatively, you can add a parameter to the
readObj and writeObj methods to include the file name.

<LI> The invocation handler should have a method to open a file and a
method to close the file.

<LI> In the invocation handler do the following:
<UL>

<LI> If the method writeObj is called, serialize the object to the
checkpointFile. 

You may need separate methods, perhaps in another class named
SerializeTypes that has a method for each of the types that need to be
seerialized. So, the method String serializeInt(int value, int
tagName), will be called if the field type of the argument is int, and
fieldName and fieldValue of MyAllTypesFirst or MyAllTypesSecond will
be passed. This method will then return a string such as "&lt; myInt
xsi:type="xsd:int">314</myInt>", wherein "myInt" and "314" are the
arguments to the method and the rest are hardcode.

<LI> If the method readObj is caled, deserialize into an object, and
return it. Similar to SerializeTypes, you can use a
class named DeserializeTypes with methods to deserialize each of the
types.


 <UL>
   <LI> Use reflection to create the object depending on the value in the complexType element.
   <LI> Parse the names of the data members and then invoke the corresponding setX method to set the value for that data member.
</UL>

<LI> From the command line take <s>two</s> three arguments: (1) mode,
(2) N and (3) <S>output</S> file name. The mode could be "serdeser" or
"deser". The output file name we will use while testing <font
color="RED"> for the "serdeser" mode</font> is "output.txt". In the
"serdeser" mode, N referes to the NUM_OF_OBJECTS of MyAllTypesFirst
and MyAllTypesSecond each. In the "deser" mode, N refers to the number
of objects to be deserialized.</font>.


<LI> Compare the objects that were serialized in writeObj to the
objects that are returned from readObj. Correctly override <I>
equals</I> and <I> hashCode</I>. For example, if you were using the
vector data structure, you would compare if vector_old[i] is equal to
vector_new[i]. Vector_old refers to the vector with the objects that
were serialized. vector_new refers to the deserialized objects. Report
how many objects did not match. If you run in "serdeser" mode then you
should report "0 mismatched objects" <font color="RED">to
stdout for cases where all the filds are serialized. </font>. If the TA changes the <S>serialized</S> <font
color="RED"> input file to be used to test deserialziation,in between
runs for the "deser" mode, </font> then you should deserialize the
file and print each object that was read <font colore="RED">to
stdout</RED>. So, make sure your toString(...) method prints the data
member names and values in a easy to read format, to <S>output.txt</S>
stdout.

<UL> Apply the strategy pattern for Serialization and again for
Deserialization. The Strategy in each of these two cases is to use the
XMLSerialization and XMLDeserialization for the given input. Note that
there is only one strategy each to be used in this assignment for Serialization and Deserialization.

<UL>

<LI> It is optional to have a separate method to serialize each type
used in the MyAllTypes2.txt file. If you do so, place those methods in
SerializeTypes.java and DeserializeTypes.java.

<LI> You may have a separate method to deserialize each complex type
used in the MyAllTypes2.txt file.

</UL>


<UL>

</UL>


<LI> Flow of Control

<UL>
<LI> create a Dynamic Proxy 
<LI> create a vector of SerializableObject. Populate it with instances of MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond

<LI> when you create instances of MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond
(using randomly generated values), if the value of an int, double, or
long is less than 10, then that field should NOT be serialized. As
shown in MyAllTypes2.txt, some fields could be missing from the
serialized output.

<LI> call writeObj for each instance of the vector so that the checkPoint file is created via the proxy implementation.
<LI> call readObj to read the checkpoint file objects and create a vector with the return instances.

<LI> compare the serialized and deserialized vectors and report how
many instances match. Note that the match may not be perfect if the
TA, during testing of your submission, changes the values of some of
the data members in the checkPoint file.
